	Consort CMake is a set of opinionated functions and macros for
	<a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> designed to make managing large
	projects easier.

			<h2 class="md-title">Declarative</h2>
			<p class="md-caption">
				The Consort syntax for creating targets is designed to look
				"declarative", making it easier to read and remember how to
				add new targets. Stop worrying about your build environment and
				start focusing on your code!

			<h2 class="md-title">YASM</h2>
			<p class="md-caption">
				Out-of-the-box support for YASM assembly makes it as painless as
				possible to add ASM optimisations to your code that will behave
				the same way regardless of the targeted compiler. Consort adds
				plenty of convenience macros as well, so when your assembler
				needs to know about the target platform you can easily use the
				YASM preprocessor to switch on the appropriate instructions to
				handle platform specific calling conventions.

			<h2 class="md-title">Qt</h2>
			<p class="md-caption">
				Out-of-the-box support for Qt makes it easy to incorporate Qt
				into your build. Consort can find Qt for you, and perform much
				of the configuration necessary to build Qt UI files, resources
				and translations into your code.

			<h2 class="md-title">Boost</h2>
			<p class="md-caption">
				Out-of-the-box support for Boost means you can easily make use
				of the boost libraries in your code. Consort will sanitise the
				boost libraries as much as possible to make sure you have an
				easy to use and consistent cross platform build.

			<h2 class="md-title">Modules</h2>
			<p class="md-caption">
				Consort's built in module system makes it easy to share code,
				without slowing down your build by introducing targets that
				don't need to be built. Consort will automatically detect when
				you link to a module, and include the CMake code necessary to
				build that target. Plus, no more merge conflicts on the top
				level CMakeLists.txt as it won't need updating as often.

			<h2 class="md-title">And more...</h2>
			<p class="md-caption">
				Consort includes numerous other options and default
				configuration to help you get your project up and running faster,
				including automatically setting suitable warning levels, adding
				consistently named #defines for architecture and platform, and
				tools to copy required resources to your build directory.
